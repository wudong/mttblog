Being a [web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application)
our website differs from most other websites that provide service for the life in the uk test.
**The key point of our system lies in the ability to keep track of your practice history
and your progress based on that.**
However to make the system work in your way, there are a few things you should be notices
when use the website.

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> Browse questions
You can simply [browse]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/question-browse)our question bank and
 Within it, you can browse the question page by page, search question by keywords, by categories,
or by tags. You can also answer questions while you are browsing, and the answering
will be saved automatically for you as part of your practice history.

<i class="fa fa-book fa-lg pull-left fa-border"></i>
The <a href="/question-practise">question practice</a> function
allow you to practise with the questions in a systematic way.
You do not want to practice with the questions that you have answered correctly
again and again while omitting the questions you found difficult. This is what
likely happens in the  <a href="/question-browse"> question browser</a> and in most other websites.
With our question practice function, question is presented one by one, in an order according to your
<strong>practice history</strong>, so that you could get more
chance to practise with the questions that are difficult to you, and remember them better.
<strong>This is the recommended approach to use our website.</strong>

<i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-lg pull-left fa-border"></i>
The <a href="/question-test">test simulator</a>
gives you the feeling of how
a real life test will be alike. It is similar to the <a href="/question-practise">question practice</a> function but you will not be able to see
any feedback of your answers until you finished and submitted. You could use it to evaluate your
capability as to the test because all the questions presented in the test simulator are from
<strong>real test</strong> (reported by people who has taken the test)!

<i class="fa fa-bookmark fa-lg pull-left fa-border"></i> The <span class="text-info">bookmark function</span>
 provides a convenient way to keep records of the questions you feel difficult, important, and/or uncertain
 (or whatever you feel really). We also have many ways to let you <span class="text-info">review</span>
  the questions from different
 angles: you can review the questions that you practised wrong,
 that we feel they are difficult for you, that you bookmarked, and so on.

<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-lg pull-left fa-border"></i>
The <span class="text-info">information panel</span> helps you keep track of your practice.
It gives you the detail information on how many questions you have answered,
how many you have done right, wrong, and how many you have marked as important. These information
is given for the current session of practice, or if you are a login user, for all the practice
you have done. Best of all, you can easily start reviewing all your questions from there.
You can also see your overall progress there and determine if it is a right time to start booking
the test!

An important <strong>rule of thumb</strong>: if you are unsure of a question, always bookmark it before try answering.
In this way, you can save the question for later review, or you will lose it if you fluke it right.
