Being a [web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application)
our website differs from most other websites that provide service for the life in the uk test.
The **key point** of our system lies in the ability to **keep track of your practice history**
and your progress based on that.
However to make the system work in your way, there are a few things you should be aware
when use the website.

## <i class="fa fa-book"></i> Practise questions
The [question practice]({{site.url}}/question-practise) function is the main practise system
provided by our website. It allow you to practise with the questions in a systematic,
and efficient way. **This is the recommended approach to use our website**.

You do not want to practice with the questions that you have answered correctly
again and again while omitting the questions you found difficult. This is what
likely happens while you are just browsing the questions.

With our question practice system, question is presented one by one, in an order according to your
**practice history**, so that you could get more
chance to practise with the questions that are difficult to you, and remember them better.
All you need to do is to answer the questions presented, we will do the rest for you.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Underneath the system, every question is given a score according your previous
taking on it. If a question you have answered wrong, or bookmarked, it will receive a higher
score which make it more likely to appear in your next practise.
</div>

### <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Information Panel
The [information panel]({{site.url}}) gives every details of your practice history.
It gives you real time information on how many questions you have answered,
how many you have done right, wrong, and how many you have marked as important.

These information
is given for the current session of practice, or if you are a login user, for all the practice
you have done. Always keeps an eye on this to know you progress and find out which
questions are difficult to you.

### <i class="fa fa-bookmark-o"></i> Bookmarks
The bookmark function not only let you keep records of the questions
 you feel uncertain, so you can easily go back to it.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
If you are unsure of a question,
always bookmark it before try answering. In this way, you can save the question
for later review, or you will lose it if you fluke it right.
</div>

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> Test Simulator
The [test simulator]({{site.url}}/question-test)
gives you the feeling of how
a real life test will be alike. It is similar to
the question practice function but you will not be able to see
any feedback of your answers until you finished and submitted the test.

You could use it to evaluate your
capability as to the test because all the questions presented in the test simulator are from
**real test** (reported by people who has taken the test)!

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> Browse questions
This is what most other website provides, and is a less recommended way to use our system.
You can simply [browse]({{site.url}}/question-browse) our question bank and
within it, you can browse the question page by page, search question by keywords, by categories,
or by tags.

You can also answer questions while you are browsing, and the answering
will be saved automatically for you as part of your practice history.
